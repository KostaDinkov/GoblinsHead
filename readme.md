Goblin’s Head Tavern
====================

This is a project assignment from Udacitys “Android Development for Beginners”
course. The app represents a single screen app that displays information about a
fictional tavern. The app has entirely educational purpose. Here are the project
specifications and requirements:

**Build a Single Screen App**

**Project Overview**

To test your skills from this free course, design and implement a single screen
app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the
lines of your favorite coffee shop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store
that sells those rare comic books or records.

**Suggested App Ideas**

-   Details about a small business in your neighborhood

-   Contact info and description about your workplace or school

-   Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) you’re part
    of and how new members can sign up

**Requirements**

Your design must include:

-   Business name

-   At least one photo representing the business

-   Two or more other pieces of information, such as:

    -   Contact information for the business (e.g. phone number, email address,
        website)

    -   Address of the Business

    -   Description of business

    -   Hours of operation

Note: This is **not** required but if you’re up for a making real impact in your
community, go check out an actual local business and obtain their consent to
build an app for them!
